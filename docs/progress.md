## 2026-10-29 — S0a: harness, research ledgers, design, ADRs, prompts

**Done**
- Harness: Claude Code hooks (publishing guard, tool guard, per-edit doc check, Stop check, session brief), git hooks (pre-commit token scan, pre-push needs `ALLOW_PUSH=1` and scans history), `scripts/check_docs.py`, 86 pytest cases.
- Research: `docs/research/sources.yaml` (52 sources; 11 re-read by the orchestrator and marked `main-reread`), `docs/research/assumptions.yaml` (76 parameters graded S/P/D/A), `docs/research/README.md`.
- Re-reading the sources changed the design: neat-sample viability does not decline within the tested hold (A038–A040), so hold-time viability loss is a scenario knob, not the headline. The headline cases are "feed in the gap" (joining by measured time pairs a pre-feed value with post-feed process state) and offline pH used to re-standardise the online probe (S013).
- Design: `docs/design/simulation_spec.md`, `docs/design/data_model.md`.
- Decisions: ADR-0001 to ADR-0012, all `Proposed`.
- Prompts: `prompts/PRINCIPLES.md` (stage-by-stage principle combinations) plus master, S1, S2, author-track, review-rubric and external-review briefs.

**Open for the author (HITL)**
- Create the private backup repository and push (command given in chat; the AI does not push).
- Read ADR-0001 to ADR-0012; flip the ones you agree with to `Accepted`, write the decider's note, and commit that change yourself.

**Next (S0b, start a new session inside this repo)**
1. Confirm the hooks fire live (session brief, publishing guard, edit check, Stop check).
2. README (English first, Korean summary).
3. Infographic (`infographic/src` → `build.py` → `index.html`), headless QA script, private preview link.
4. Vault hub note.

## 2026-10-29 — S0a review round and rework

**Done**
- Three independent reviews (two Opus agents, one external codex `gpt-6.1-sol` xhigh); 31 findings, all accepted. Public summary: `docs/reviews/2026-10-29_s0a_review.md`.
- Harness: `check_all.sh --manual` gate, change detection by repository state (catches shell edits), tests in the gate, public-number check extended to `docs/research/README.md` with assumption → source tracing, ledger schema (range/unit, bundle components, weakest-grade rule), two more publishing commands blocked. 155 tests.
- Research: 118 assumptions (A077–A118 added), 56 sources; grades corrected (cell-free pH offset → P, vendor bead study → P, unsourced range ends marked); neat-sample viability wording corrected.
- Design: `data_model.md` is the naming authority; `hold_time`/`turnaround` defined once; `two_clocks` vs `write_time_keys` separated; as-of covers result versions and historian rows; S2 gates are structural forced-error fixtures, stochastic comparisons are reported, never gated; false-alarm rate and M/M/c step added.
- Prompts: design is the source of truth; `00_master_build.md` trimmed to invariants, gates, ownership and pointers; author-track cards aligned with `data_model.md`; untracked-aware commands; tool verdicts listed.

**Open for the author (HITL)**
- Private backup repository and first push (command in chat).
- ADR-0001 to ADR-0012: decide, write the decider's note, commit yourself.

**Open questions**
- The evaluator may read the truth world (needed to score); recorders and the decision layer may not. Recorded in `simulation_spec.md` observation contract.
- `scripts/check_docs.py` is 346 lines (target ≤300): split it in a structure-only commit at the start of S1.
- Before S0b puts numbers on a public page, the orchestrator must re-read the sources behind them (currently 11 are `main-reread`; new kinetics and precision sources S003, S053–S056 are `agent-read`).

**Next**: S0b in a new session started inside the repo.
